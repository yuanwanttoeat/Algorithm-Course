## HW1 Master Therorem
proof of all three scenarios in the Master Theorem

## HW2 Dynamic Table
prove the amortized cost for a single operation applied to dynamic table is constant, expansion and contraction are allowed.

$A_k(n)$, also known as CLRS-Ackermann Function mentioned in the chapter of "Data Structures for Disjoint Sets"

Show that the value of $A_4(1)$ is much larger than $10^{80}$

## HW4 the degree of any node of an Fibonacci Heap
show that the upper bound D(n) on the degree of any node of an n-node Fibonacci heap is $O(lg(n))$

## Programming Assignement
